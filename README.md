### Changes SOPs -- Essential need to separate Year required for product from the whole SOP
1. Some SOPs require for the end user to login into a third party portal and fetch data from there 
2. Some SOPs are videos instead of text - CATIC Limited Search/Bringdown Search - New Product
3. Some SOPs have docx attached to them for maybe filling that data ? - CATIC-MUNICIPAL SEARCH https://pippin.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TP/pages/2481094660/CATIC-MUNICIPAL+SEARCH
4. Sub pdfs and docx in SOPs need to be segregated seperately
